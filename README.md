# roguenexus
##### This repository is basically used to share the various scripts and configuration files used for Rogue Nexus

###Chroot Scripts
##### Basically, these are scripts used by dgamelaunch within the chroot jail. I think the ADOM scripts have some unused functions in the bash scripts, so ignore that, they're pretty messy.

###External Scripts
##### These are scripts used mainly for record keeping and interaction with the IRC channel. There are python scripts to parse the Sil, Angband, and PCB score files. The rest are monitor scripts and parsing scripts for the score files. You can see the multitude of different scripts to monitor each games score files, which is prompting the need for forking dgamelaunch.
